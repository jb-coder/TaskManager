# Task Manager Application

This is a simple **Task Manager** application built with **Vue.js** for the frontend and **.NET Core Web API** for the backend. The application allows users to manage tasks with the following features:

## Features
- **View tasks**: Display a list of tasks with their status (completed or not).
- **Add new tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Update tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or edit the task's title.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.

## Frontend (Vue.js)
The frontend is built with **Vue.js** and uses **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the backend API. The UI is styled using **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive design.
